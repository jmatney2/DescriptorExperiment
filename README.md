# Descriptor Experiment

This Unity app tests how many discriptors people prefer to have when aided by AR gestures.

## Usage

This program was designed using Unity 2018.3.11f and Visual Studio 2017.
To carry out the experiment, give the subject the AR headset and instruct them to proceed through all 25 scenes.

The scenes themselves are described by the files in the Resources folder.

## To Do

1. Test build on Hololens
2. Scale size of objects and scenes to fit within the Hololens display
3. Design a survey to test the effectiveness of the descriptors
